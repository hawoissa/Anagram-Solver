# Anagram-Solver
An anagram is a word or phrase made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example,
the words “midterm” and “trimmed” are anagrams. If you ignore spaces and capitalization and allow
multiple words, a multi-word phrase can be an anagram of some other word or phrase. For example, the
phrases “Clint Eastwood” and “old west action” are anagrams.



AnagramSolver uses a dictionary to print all anagram
phrases of a given word or phrase. The class uses recursive backtracking to implement your algorithm.
AnagramMain prompts the user for a phrase and then
passes that phrase to your AnagramSolver, which will then print all its anagrams.
